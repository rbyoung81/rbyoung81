- 👋 Hi, I’m Rob
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing my skills with html, CSS, & JS.  I began teaching myself about a year ago, but I started the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele about a week ago.
- 🌱 For my job, I’m currently working on creating e-Forms for data collection.  These forms work within an exisitng system (MasterControl)
- 💞️ If anyone has experience with creating custom e-Forms in MasterControl, I'd love to hear about what you've worked on.
- 📫 How to reach me rbyoung@gmail.com
